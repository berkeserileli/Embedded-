----------------------Distance Detector------------------------

- It was aimed at measuring distance via an ultrasonic sensor.
- Measured data is split and transmitted to the serial port as two digits. SG90 Servo tracks angle 0 degrees to 360 (scaled with 0-100cm distance via ultrasonic sensor)
- Distance is displayed via 7 Segment Display.
- Interrupt button was used to start-stop the process
- LEDs were adjusted to indicate the distance with 3 levels (green, green+ blue, green+ blue+ red)
